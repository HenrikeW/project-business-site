# Källslätten Hay Harvest - building a business site

The purpose of this project was to design a simple business website on a self-chosen topic, in this case a sign-up page for an event of a local community. The main objective was to train forms in html and test Javascript for the first time while building an FAQ-accordion. This is one of the first websites I created during the Technigo Bootcamp in fall 2020, on my way to become a frontend developer.

## The requirements - what you'll find in the code

Following the requirements of the project, I built a header with a reponsive background-image that also chooses between different filesizes depending on the screensize. As responsiveness wasn't the focus of the project, the header is the only responsive part of the site. 
Below, you'll find a sign-up form using different input types and some validation. The data is sent to a test server called httpbin just to know that the form works.
Next to the form, you'll find an FAQ-accordion that folds in and out using the toggle-function in Javascript. There are also some built-in animations. 
Finally there's a footer on the page, mostly for aesthetics.

## Browser compatibility

I've tested the page in Chrome, Edge and Firefox for mobile, tablet and screen width using the respective dev tools. Everything works as expected.
